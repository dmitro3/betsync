this is how to make titles: 

1) when something is good or positive or the guy won something : "<:yes:1355501647538815106> | title" , interchange the "title" for the actual title
2)when something is bad or negative or the guy lost something : "<:no:1344252518305234987> | title" , interchange the "title" for the actual title
3) when something is loading use "<a:loading:1344611780638412811> | loading" interchange loading for suitable text if needed
4) when something is for information like help embed or something use ":information_source: | title", interchange the "title" for the actual title
5) for anything else, use "emoji | title", replace emoji and title with the respective emoji and title
